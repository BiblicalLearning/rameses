And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.

                <div class="historical-note">
                    <h4>📍 Location & Identification</h4>
                    <p>Rameses (also spelled Raamses) was one of the treasure cities built by the enslaved Israelites in Egypt. Most scholars identify it with the ancient Egyptian city of Pi-Ramesses, located in the eastern Nile Delta region, near modern-day Qantir.</p>
                </div>

                <p><strong>The City of Rameses:</strong> This was a major Egyptian city built during the reign of Ramesses II (1279-1213 BC), though some scholars place the Exodus earlier. The city served as:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 30px; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li>A royal residence and administrative center</li>
                    <li>A strategic military base in the eastern Delta</li>
                    <li>A monument to Pharaonic power and Egyptian gods</li>
                    <li>The staging ground for the greatest demonstration of God's power over Egypt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Night of Passover</h3>
                <p>The Exodus from Rameses occurred on the night of the Passover, following the tenth and final plague - the death of the firstborn. This was not a hasty, disorganized flight but a deliberate departure "with an high hand" (boldly and openly), as the Egyptians were burying their dead and their entire religious system lay in ruins.</p>

                <div class="fact-box">
                    <strong>📊 The Numbers:</strong> Approximately 600,000 men, plus women and children, suggesting a total population of 2-3 million people left Egypt. This massive migration also included a "mixed multitude" - likely other enslaved peoples and Egyptians who chose to follow the God of Israel.

                <h2>💎 Spiritual Significance</h2>
                
                <h3>Redemption Through Blood</h3>
                <p>The Passover lamb's blood on the doorposts foreshadowed Christ, our Passover (1 Corinthians 5:7). Just as Israel was redeemed from physical bondage through blood, all believers are redeemed from sin's bondage through Christ's blood.</p>

                <h3>From Slavery to Freedom</h3>
                <p>The departure from Rameses represents the believer's deliverance from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son (Colossians 1:13). Egypt symbolizes the world system, and the Exodus represents salvation and sanctification.</p>

                <h3>God's Faithfulness to His Covenant</h3>
                <p>God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Exodus 2:24). The Exodus from Rameses was the fulfillment of prophecy given 430 years earlier (Genesis 15:13-14).</p>

                <div class="fact-box">
                    <strong>🎯 Key Principle:</strong> "When the LORD brought back the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream" (Psalm 126:1). The Israelites left as slaves and would enter Canaan as a free nation under God.
